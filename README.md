# Connectame-Native

## Motivation
Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico and destroyed the houses and disrupted the supply of energy, food, and water. The residents 
faced two main challenges. The organization who distributed the donated items could not ensure the donated items reached
the people who needed them, and the process of distributing the donated items was inefficient. 

## Summary
A native Android mobile app that enables peer-to-peer donation transactions in Puerto Rico. It is created in #100Hacks Hackathon for Puerto Rico.

This mobile app guarantees the donated items reach the people who need them as the donor inputs the items he/she donates and his/her location, and the 
recepient inputs the items such as food and water he/she needs and his/her location. The app will match them and if a person is travelling from
the place of donor to recipient, it will notify the person the route to pick up the donated items and deliver the items to the
recepients.
